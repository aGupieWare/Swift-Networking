Swift-Networking
================
The project is broken up into two major parts. In the first part, we build a custom web service in PHP which provides access to a RESTful API that serves inventory content from a hypothetical plumbing supply shop. In the second part, we use iOS table views to create a Swift application to query our custom API and deliver the contents of the service to the end user of the application. The project accompanies our programming tutorial that can be found on our blog.agupieware.com.
